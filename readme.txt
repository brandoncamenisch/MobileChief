MobileChief is a powerful, extendable mobile site builder that helps you create stunning mobile landing pages.

== Description ==

MobileChief is a powerful, extendable mobile site builder that makes it easier than ever to create mobile landing pages and mobile sites with an intuitive drag and drop interface. 

Unlike other WordPress Mobile Plugins, MobileChief doesn't take your existing WordPress site and convert it to a Mobile Optimized Site, rather it lets you create new content in new mobile sites.

The ability to create mobile sites like this, allows you to run mobile marketing campaigns with targeted information, rather than sending a user to a full website where they may get lost and never find the information you're trying to provide.

= UNLIMITED SITES & PAGES =

From a single WordPress install, users can create unlimited Mobile Sites, each with unlimited pages. 

Each site can have it's own theme, options, pages and content. 

All themes are optimized for mobile devices small and large, and even look good on desktops.

= THE MAGIC OF TWITTER BOOTSTRAP =

MobileChief takes advantage of the world's most loved responsive framework, the Twitter Bootstrap.

This allows for easily adding new basic and premium themes, as well as basic and premium page element add-ons.

= EXTENSIVE API =

MobileChief has several APIs that make it easy for developers to extend, including a Theme API, Site Settings API, Plugin Settings API, Page Element API and more. 

= ADD-ONS GALORE =

MobileChief is built by the experienced folk at PluginChief who offer support for MobileChief and also supply premium MobileChief add-ons as well as other handy WordPress plugins, tutorials and more. 

PluginChief allows users to sign up for a PluginChief membership for a low yearly price to access ALL PluginChief plugins, or users can purchase plugins individually. 

= AFFILIATE PROGRAM =

PluginChief also offers an affiliate program, paying out 25% for all individual plugin purchases or yearly membership sales.

= GET INVOLVED =

Developers are welcome to create extensions and add-ons. Suggestions for future updates to MobileChief or suggestions for add-ons are welcome at PluginChief.com.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.3 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of MobileChief, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “MobileChief” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our Mobile Site Builder plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our Mobile Site Builder plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off chance you do encounter issues with the sites or pages pages after an update, you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.

= Will MobileChief work with my theme? =
